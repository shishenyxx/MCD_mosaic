# Pipeline for MuTect2 paired mode and Strelka2 somatic mode 
The pipeline is a snakemake wrapper to run MuTect2 and Strelka2.
The pipeline is very similar to the [published version] (https://github.com/shishenyxx/Adult_brain_somatic_mosaicism/tree/master/pipelines/WGS_SNV_indel_calling_pipeline/Mutect2_PM_Strelka2) with slight changes considering the total file size from each sample.
